<!-- 
This is the test nodlets with level db

How to run:

Instructions at http://www.ros.org/wiki/nodelet/Tutorials/Running%20a%20nodelet
In detail: 

run roscore
>> roscore

Launch nodelet manager
>> rosrun nodelet nodelet load test_nodelet1_ns/test_nodelet1 nodelet_manager __name:=nodelet1

Launch nodelet1 
>> rosrun nodelet nodelet load test_nodelet1_ns/test_nodelet1 nodelet_manager __name:=nodelet1

Launch nodelet2
>> rosrun nodelet nodelet load test_nodelet2_ns/test_nodelet2 nodelet_manager __name:=nodelet2

Now Db was created but everything is stalled because no point cloud is received.

To publish a pc do
rosbag play {bag file containing point clouds on topic /camera/depth_registered/points} -l
>> rosbag play pointcloud.bag -l
